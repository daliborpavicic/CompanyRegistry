This is the sample project used for comparison of different JavaScript frameworks/libraries for Web front-end. The main idea is to analyze pro and cons of each framework and make it easier to decide on which and when to use one. The following frameworks are used:

* AngularJS
* Angular2+
* React
* Elm

The main features are:

* a tabular preview of companies, employees, and places with a possibility to filter and sort the data by any column
